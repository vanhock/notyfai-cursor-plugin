# Notyfai

Push notifications to your phone when Cursor AI agents finish or need your permission.

Notyfai is a Cursor plugin that sends agent events to the Notyfai backend. When the agent is blocked (e.g. waiting for shell or MCP permission) or stops, you get a push notification on your mobile device.

## Install

1. **Install from the Cursor Marketplace**  
   Open the marketplace in Cursor, search for **Notyfai**, and install the plugin.

2. **Get the Notyfai app**  
   Install the Notyfai mobile app and sign in. From the app you get a unique hook URL for your account.

3. **Configure the hook URL**  
   The plugin script needs your hook URL. Choose one:

   - **Global (recommended):** Run in a terminal (use the copy command from the app):
     ```bash
     echo 'YOUR_HOOK_URL' > ~/.cursor/notyfai-url
     ```
   - **Environment variable:** In `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:
     ```bash
     export NOTYFAI_HOOK_URL='YOUR_HOOK_URL'
     ```
   - **Per project:** From the project root:
     ```bash
     echo 'YOUR_HOOK_URL' > .cursor/notyfai-url
     ```
     Add `.cursor/notyfai-url` to `.gitignore` so the URL is not committed.

4. **Restart Cursor** so it loads the plugin and hooks.

## What triggers notifications

- **Agent blocked** — The agent is waiting for permission (e.g. shell command, MCP call, file read with "ask" or "deny"). A push is sent after a short debounce (about 15 seconds).
- **Agent stopped** — The agent run finished (`stop` event). You get an immediate notification.

All other hook events (session start/end, tool use, file edits, etc.) are sent to the backend for execution tracking and history; they do not trigger push notifications by themselves.

## Full setup and troubleshooting

For manual setup without the plugin, localhost notes, and troubleshooting (no notifications, token issues, push not received), see the [main Notyfai repo](https://github.com/notyfai/notyfai) (e.g. `docs/configure-hook.md`).
